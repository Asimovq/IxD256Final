# IxD256Final

## Implementation
The inital concept is to further develop the last project by including visualization based on the weather data from the internet. The final outcome is mostly similar to the initial concept.



## Hardware
Explain your process of prototype development including all applicable aspects such as hardware (electronics), firmware (arduino code), software (p5.js or other code), integrations (Adafruit IO, IFTTT, Arduino IoT cloud, etc.), enclosure and mechanical design. Use a separate subheader for each part:



## Firmware
List all the separate hardware components used in your project and briefly explain what they do. Include a schematic diagram image (Fritzing is recommended, but hand-drawn is OK) showing all the wiring connections between the M5Stack-CoreInk board and other components.

In addition, include at least one photo showing your hardware wiring. This can be several close-ups with the goal of showing how the wiring connections are made. This is especially important if your project has an enclosure, to reveal what is inside.


## Software
Provide a link to your Arduino code and explain a few important parts that make your prototype work. Most likely you should explain the inputs/outputs used in your code and how they affect the behavior of the prototype. 

## Integrations
Include a link to and/or screenshots of other functional components of your project, like Adafruit IO feeds, dashboards, IFTTT applets, etc. In general, think of your audience as someone new trying to learn how to make your project and make sure to cover anything helpful to explain the functional parts of it.

## Enclosure / Mechanical Design
Explain how you made the enclosure or any other physical or mechanical aspects of your project with photos, screenshots of relevant files such as laser-cut patterns, 3D models, etc. (it’s great if you’re willing to share the editable source files too!)



## Project outcome

Summarize the results of your final project implementation and include at least 2 photos of the prototype and a video walkthrough of the functioning demo.


## Conclusion
As you wrap up the project, reflect on your experience of creating it. Use this as an opportunity to mention any discoveries or challenges you came across along the way. If there is anything you would have done differently, or have a chance to continue the project development given more time or resources, it’s a good way to conclude this section.



## Project references
Please include links to any online resources like videos or tutorials that you may have found helpful in your process of implementing the prototype. If you used any substantial code from an online resource, make sure to credit the author(s) or sources.
